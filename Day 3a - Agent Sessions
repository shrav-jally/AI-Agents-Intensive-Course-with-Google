This is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and designing drugs that interact with specific protein conformations.\n*   **Predicting Drug-Target Interactions:** AI is getting better at predicting how well a potential drug molecule will bind to its intended protein target, and importantly, whether it will bind to *off-target* proteins, which can cause side effects.\n\n**3. AI-Powered Repurposing of Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets of existing drug information, clinical trial data, and scientific literature to identify drugs that might be effective for treating new conditions. This is significantly faster and cheaper than developing a drug from scratch.\n*   **Identifying Synergistic Combinations:** AI can also predict which existing drugs, when used in combination, might have a synergistic effect, leading to more potent treatments.\n\n**4. Streamlining Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of a drug succeeding in pre-clinical animal studies and, more importantly, in human clinical trials. This helps prioritize the most promising candidates and de-risk the development process.\n*   **Optimizing Trial Design:** AI can help identify ideal patient populations for clinical trials, predict patient responses, and monitor for adverse events, making trials more efficient and ethical.\n*   **Digital Twins:** The concept of creating \"digital twins\" of patients or disease models is emerging, allowing researchers to simulate drug effects in a virtual environment before testing in humans.\n\n**5. AI in Rare Disease Drug Discovery:**\n\n*   **Addressing Data Scarcity:** Rare diseases often have limited data available, making traditional drug discovery challenging. AI can help by leveraging data from related diseases, analyzing genomic information to identify disease mechanisms, and even identifying potential targets from sparse datasets.\n\n**6.

This is a foundational area that underpins many other AI applications in healthcare.\n\nLet me break it down further:\n\n**The Core Problem:**\n\nProteins are the workhorses of our cells. They perform a vast array of functions, from catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes) to transporting molecules and acting as structural components. The **function of a protein is intimately linked to its three-dimensional shape (its structure).**\n\nFor decades, determining a protein's structure was an incredibly difficult, time-consuming, and expensive process, often involving techniques like X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. This bottleneck significantly hindered our understanding of disease mechanisms and the design of drugs that could interact with specific proteins.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This:**\n\nAI, particularly deep learning, has made monumental leaps in predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences.\n\n1.  **AlphaFold (and its successors):**\n    *   **The Breakthrough:** Google DeepMind's AlphaFold was a watershed moment. It demonstrated an AI system that could predict the 3D structure of a protein with accuracy comparable to experimental methods for many proteins. It achieved this by leveraging massive datasets of known protein structures and using deep neural networks trained to understand the complex physical and evolutionary constraints that govern protein folding.\n    *   **Impact:** AlphaFold has made millions of protein structures publicly available, democratizing structural biology and accelerating research across the globe. Scientists can now readily access the structures of proteins relevant to diseases they are studying.\n\n2.  **Beyond Static Structures: Predicting Dynamics and Interactions:**\n    *   **The Limitation of Static Models:** While AlphaFold predicts a highly probable, stable structure, proteins are not rigid. They are dynamic molecules that can change shape, flex, and interact with other molecules.\n    *   **Current AI Focus:** Newer AI research is focusing on predicting:\n        *   **Protein Dynamics:** How proteins move and change shape over time. This is crucial because a protein's active site might only be accessible in a specific, transient conformation.\n        *   **Protein-Ligand Binding:** How a drug molecule (ligand) will bind to a protein. This involves predicting not just the binding site but also the strength and orientation of the interaction.\n        *   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** How different proteins bind to each other. Many cellular processes involve complex protein complexes, and understanding these interactions is key to understanding disease and developing therapies that modulate them.\n        *   **Effect of Mutations:** How genetic mutations (which change the amino acid sequence) affect protein structure and function. This is vital for understanding inherited diseases and designing targeted therapies.\n\n**Why This is Crucial for Drug Discovery:**\n\n*   **Target Identification and Validation:** Knowing the precise 3D structure of a protein involved in a disease allows researchers to identify it as a potential drug target and understand how to best interact with it.\n*   **Rational Drug Design:** Instead of trial-and-error, AI-predicted structures enable *rational* drug design. Scientists can design drug molecules that are shaped to fit perfectly into the active site of a target protein, maximizing efficacy and minimizing off-target effects.\n*   **Understanding Drug Resistance:** When drugs stop working, it's often due to mutations in the target protein that alter its structure. AI can help predict how these mutations affect drug binding, paving the way for developing next-generation drugs that overcome resistance.\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Side Effects:** By understanding how a drug interacts with its intended target *and* other proteins in the body, AI can help predict the drug's effectiveness and potential side effects.\n\n**In essence, AI-driven protein structure prediction is providing a detailed blueprint of the molecular machinery of life. This blueprint is invaluable for designing drugs that can precisely and effectively modulate cellular processes to treat diseases.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of using AI for protein folding and structure prediction.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
